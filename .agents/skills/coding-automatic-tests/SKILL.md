description: Use when writing or adding xUnit tests for C# classes, structs, or extension methods - Facts partial class structure, naming, shared test-data fixtures in DiGi.Test/files/, test reports and diagnostic dumps written to DiGi.Test/user files/reports/, and serialization, tolerance-boundary, and performance test patterns. Also covers measuring a benchmark Fact in isolation (a figure read off a full-suite run is contaminated by xUnit parallel collections and is not comparable to an isolated one), opening a defect fix with a Fact that reproduces the reported symptom on the unmodified code, and proving a kept fallback unreachable before deleting it.

# AI Guidelines: Automatic Tests

**Goal:** Generate warning-free xUnit tests covering logic, edge-case tolerance boundaries, serialization correctness, and performance benchmarks.

---

## 1. Coding Rules

- Conform strictly to production C# guidelines (see [Coding - General.md](Coding%20-%20General.md)): English only, explicit typing (no `var`), camelCase naming with type prefixes (`pointNode_Base`), plural element collection names (`point3Ds`), zero compiler/analyzer warnings.

---

## 2. xUnit Project Structure

- **Naming:** One test project per project: `[ProjectName].xUnit` (e.g. `DiGi.Core.xUnit`).
- **Test Class:** `public partial class Facts` under `/Facts/` directory. One shared `Facts` class per namespace.
- **Namespace:** Matches test project (`namespace DiGi.Core.xUnit`).
- **Usings:** `Xunit` is configured as a global using — **do NOT add `using Xunit;`**.
- **Attributes:** Mark test methods with `[Fact]`.
- **Method Naming:** Name method directly after target class/property/method (`Color()`, `PlanarIntersectionResult_Performance()`).
- **Documentation:** Include XML `<summary>` on every test method. Do not leave blank lines in doc blocks; use `<para>`.

---

## 3. Shared Test Data Fixtures & Test Reports

- **Shared Input Data Fixtures (`DiGi.Test/files/`):**
  - **Directory Path:** `DiGi.Test/files/` (workspace root level; do not create per-project data folders).
  - **Asset Access:** Read input files in place. Do not set `<CopyToOutputDirectory>`.
  - **Path Resolution:**
    - File path: `Core.xUnit.Query.FilePath(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), "fileName.ext")`
    - Directory path: `assembly.FilesDirectory()`
    - Requires `using System.Reflection;`. Call fully-qualified: `Core.xUnit.Query.FilePath(...)`.
    - `FilePath` asserts directory existence and fails cleanly if missing.
- **Default Path for Test Reports & Diagnostic Outputs (`DiGi.Test/user files/reports/`):**
  - **Rule:** ALL reports, text dumps, benchmark logs, and diagnostic output files produced during test execution MUST be saved to `user files/reports/` (never in `files/`).
  - **Path Resolution Helpers:**
    - Reports directory: `assembly.ReportsDirectory()` or `Core.xUnit.Query.ReportsDirectory(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly())` (resolves and creates `DiGi.Test/user files/reports/`).
    - User files directory: `assembly.UserFilesDirectory()` (resolves and creates `DiGi.Test/user files/`).
  - **Portability:** Use relative paths or extension methods. Do NOT hardcode machine-specific absolute paths.

```csharp
using System.Reflection;

// Resolving input fixture file path
string? pathInput = Core.xUnit.Query.FilePath(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), "sample.gmf");
Assert.False(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(pathInput));
Assert.True(System.IO.File.Exists(pathInput));

// Resolving test report output path
string? pathReportsDir = Core.xUnit.Query.ReportsDirectory(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
Assert.False(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(pathReportsDir));

string reportFilePath = System.IO.Path.Combine(pathReportsDir!, "Diagnostic_Report.txt");
System.IO.File.WriteAllLines(reportFilePath, reportLines);
```

## 4. Testing Patterns

- **Assertions:** Use standard xUnit assertions (`Assert.Equal`, `Assert.True`/`False`, `Assert.NotNull`/`Null`, `Assert.Single`).
- **Serialization Round-Trip:**
  - Call `Core.xUnit.Query.SerializationCheck(instance)`.
  - Validate string conversion: `Convert.ToSystem_String(object)` and `Convert.ToDiGi<T>(json)?.FirstOrDefault()`.
  - Every `SerializableObject` class must have a `[Fact]` testing constructor state, string conversion, and `SerializationCheck`.
  - **`SerializationCheck` only sees the members your instance populates.** It compares the instance's JSON against the JSON of `Clone()` — which for `SerializableObject` runs the **copy constructor** — so a member the copy constructor forgot is caught only if the fact set that member to something. A member left at its default is invisible to it, and the JSON leg keeps passing regardless, because serialization is reflection-driven and never notices. **When you add a member to a serializable type, populate it in the existing fact in the same change.** `DiGi.GIS.YOLO.UI`'s `YearBuiltPredictionPipelineOptions` gained `Radiuses`, and the same commit omitted it from the copy constructor *and* from the committed `.json.template`; the green fact could see neither, because it set `Years` and never `Radiuses`.
  - For models holding timestamps or dates, test `DateTimeOffset` properties to ensure timezone and UTC offset stability across round-trip conversions (avoiding `DateTimeKind.Unspecified` equality mismatches).
- **Tolerance Boundaries:** Test floating-point operations with test cases exactly *inside* and *outside* the boundary (`Constants.Tolerance.Distance` or `1e-3`).
- **Performance Benchmarks:**
  0. **Measure the benchmark `[Fact]` in isolation** — `dotnet test <project> -c Release --filter "FullyQualifiedName~<TestName>"`. Never read a figure off a full-suite run: xUnit executes collections in parallel, so the rest of the suite competes for cores with the thing being timed. Same code, same machine, `Mesh3D_Difference_Performance`: **983 ms in-suite vs 1306-1402 ms isolated** before a fix, then **1134 ms in-suite vs 623-790 ms isolated** after it. The distortion is not a constant offset, so an in-suite number and an isolated number are **not comparable at all** — comparing the two here would have reversed the apparent sign of a 1.9x improvement.
  1. Execute a single warm-up run to trigger JIT compilation.
  2. Measure execution time using `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew()`.
  3. Repeat the measurement three times and report the **range**, not a single figure.
  4. Assert execution time remains below the designated threshold (`Assert.True(stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds < limit)`). The asserted threshold must clear the **in-suite** time, because that is how CI runs it; report the isolated range, assert against the slower path.
  5. **A/B against a real baseline, never a stale report.** To compare two implementations, keep a copy of the pre-change file, swap it back in, and re-run isolated under identical conditions. A number from an earlier report was almost certainly produced under different conditions.
- **Reproduce Before Fixing:** a defect fix opens with a `[Fact]` that fails **on the unmodified code with the reported symptom** — matching the reported stack trace when there is one — and that `[Fact]` is committed in the same change. If a synthetic fixture will not reproduce the defect, build one from real data already in `DiGi.Test/files/`. `Mesh3D_Difference_DenseCluster` and `Mesh3D_Difference_FaultIsolation` reproduced [DiGi.Geometry#2](https://github.com/ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.Geometry/issues/2)'s `ConstraintEnforcementException` with its exact stack before a line of the fix was written.
- **Proving a Kept Fallback Is Dead:** when a change keeps the previous implementation as a safety net, establish whether it is reachable instead of guessing — replace the fallback call with `throw`, run the whole suite. If nothing fails, the fallback is unreached and should be deleted rather than carried. That is how `DiGi.Geometry`'s conforming-Delaunay triangulation path was retired (326 to 126 lines) with evidence.
- **A Guard Must Be Shown To Fail:** *Reproduce Before Fixing* covers a `[Fact]` written against a known defect. A guard written **proactively** — asserting a property nobody has yet violated — gets no such proof for free, and an assertion that cannot fail for the reason it exists is worse than no test, because a comment claiming it guards something stops anyone looking again.
  - **Construct the violation and watch the assertion fail**, then restore. If it still passes, the guard is decoration.
  - **Worked example.** A smoke `[Fact]` asserted a predicted year fell between 1900 and 2100, with a comment claiming an all-default row would land outside that range and so prove features were reaching the model. Measured: a row carrying **nothing but an identifier** scored `2012`. The assertion could never have caught the binding failure it was written for — the same failure that had the deployed path scoring an R² of −1.771 while throwing nothing.
  - **Prefer a differential assertion to a plausibility range.** Ranges pass on garbage. Score the same input twice — once complete, once stripped of the thing under test — and assert the results **differ**. That tests the mechanism rather than the shape of the output.

### Basic Test & Serialization (`/Facts/Color.cs`)

```csharp
using System.Linq;

namespace DiGi.Core.xUnit
{
    public partial class Facts
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Tests Color conversion between System.Drawing.Color and string formats, validating ARGB preservation and serialization.
        /// </summary>
        [Fact]
        public void Color()
        {
            System.Drawing.Color drawingColor_1 = System.Drawing.Color.Aqua;
            Core.Classes.Color color_1 = new(drawingColor_1);

            string? string_1 = color_1.ToSystem_String();
            Assert.NotNull(string_1);

            Core.Classes.Color? color_2 = Convert.ToDiGi<Core.Classes.Color>(string_1)?.FirstOrDefault();
            Assert.NotNull(color_2);

            System.Drawing.Color drawingColor_2 = color_2.ToDrawing();
            Assert.Equal(drawingColor_1.A, drawingColor_2.A);
            Assert.Equal(drawingColor_1.R, drawingColor_2.R);
            Assert.Equal(drawingColor_1.G, drawingColor_2.G);
            Assert.Equal(drawingColor_1.B, drawingColor_2.B);

            Core.xUnit.Query.SerializationCheck(color_1);
        }
    }
}
```

### Boundary & Benchmark Test (`/Facts/PlanarIntersectionResult.cs`)

```csharp
using DiGi.Geometry.Spatial;
using DiGi.Geometry.Spatial.Classes;

namespace DiGi.Geometry.xUnit
{
    public partial class Facts
    {
        /// <summary>
        /// Tests planar intersections at tolerance boundaries and measures execution performance.
        /// </summary>
        [Fact]
        public void PlanarIntersectionResult_ToleranceBoundaries()
        {
            Plane plane = Spatial.Constants.Plane.WorldZ;
            double tolerance = 1e-3;

            // Inside boundary (Z = tolerance - 1e-9)
            Segment3D segment3D_Inside = new(new Point3D(0, 0, 1e-3 - 1e-9), new Point3D(0, 0, 10));
            PlanarIntersectionResult? result_Inside = Create.PlanarIntersectionResult(plane, segment3D_Inside, tolerance);
            Assert.NotNull(result_Inside);
            Assert.True(result_Inside.Intersect);

            // Outside boundary (Z = tolerance + 1e-9)
            Segment3D segment3D_Outside = new(new Point3D(0, 0, 1e-3 + 1e-9), new Point3D(0, 0, 10));
            PlanarIntersectionResult? result_Outside = Create.PlanarIntersectionResult(plane, segment3D_Outside, tolerance);
            Assert.NotNull(result_Outside);
            Assert.False(result_Outside.Intersect);
        }

        [Fact]
        public void PlanarIntersectionResult_Performance()
        {
            Plane plane = Spatial.Constants.Plane.WorldZ;

            // Warm up / JIT compile
            Polyline3D polyline_Warmup = new([new Point3D(0, 0, 10)]);
            _ = Create.PlanarIntersectionResult(plane, polyline_Warmup);

            List<Point3D> point3Ds = [];
            for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
            {
                point3Ds.Add(new Point3D(i, i, 10));
            }
            Polyline3D polyline3D_Complex = new(point3Ds);

            System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch stopwatch = System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch.StartNew();
            PlanarIntersectionResult? result = Create.PlanarIntersectionResult(plane, polyline3D_Complex);
            stopwatch.Stop();

            Assert.NotNull(result);
            Assert.False(result.Intersect);
            Assert.True(stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds < 5, $"Intersection check failed threshold! Elapsed: {stopwatch.ElapsedMilliseconds} ms.");
        }
    }
}
```
