description: Use when changing a WebAPI controller's route, parameter names or validation, or when writing or maintaining an HTTP client of one - why a renamed query parameter breaks clients with no compile error and no runtime error (ASP.NET silently ignores an unknown parameter and returns the unfiltered result), the binding traps where an omitted parameter keeps default(T) and an enum sentinel that is not 0 makes the obvious guard dead code, sending enum values as integers, the client base-URI constant and /Query plumbing pattern, and gating an endpoint that is not deployed yet.

# Coding — WebAPI Contracts (Controllers and Their HTTP Clients)

Rules for the wire contract between a `DiGi.*.WebAPI` controller and the code that calls it over HTTP.
Read this when changing a controller's route, parameter names or validation, and when writing or
maintaining a client (`DiGi.GIS.WebAPI.UI`, `DiGi.GIS.UI`, a background task, a page script).

For *testing* against the live host see [Coding - Deployed WebAPI.md](Coding%20-%20Deployed%20WebAPI.md).
For the `DiGi.GLTF` 3D pipeline see [Coding - WebAPI GLTF.md](Coding%20-%20WebAPI%20GLTF.md).

## 1. The contract has no compiler — a renamed parameter breaks clients in silence

> **A client reaches a `*.WebAPI` over HTTP only.** `DiGi.GIS.WebAPI.UI` has no `HintPath` and no
> project reference to `DiGi.GIS.WebAPI`. Renaming a `[FromQuery(Name = "…")]` produces **no compile
> error in the client, and no runtime error either** — ASP.NET Core silently ignores a query parameter
> it does not recognise and answers with the *unfiltered* result.

Real incident. `DiGi.GIS.WebAPI` renamed `itemsbypoint`'s filter from `type` to
`administrativearealtype`. `DiGi.GIS.WebAPI.UI/Controllers/Building2DController.cs` kept sending
`type=County` and nothing anywhere reported a problem. Measured against the deployed host:

| Request | Bytes | First item returned |
|---|---|---|
| `itemsbypoint?x=638000&y=486000&type=County` | 2 119 202 | `Polska`, code `10` — **the country** |
| `itemsbypoint?x=638000&y=486000&administrativearealtype=2` | 387 089 | `m. St. Warszawa`, code `1465` |

The client read `FirstOrDefault()`, got the country, resolved no county, and dropped `countyid` from
every downstream request — a wrong answer plus a 5x payload, for months, with a clean build.

**After changing any route or parameter name, diff the two sides by hand.** Nothing else catches it.
Declared names on the API side:

```bash
grep -rnoE '\[FromQuery\(Name = "[^"]+"\)\]' --include=*.cs DiGi.GIS.WebAPI/Classes/Controller/ | sort -u
```

Sent names across **every** consumer — the GIS Web API has more than one, which is easy to forget:

```bash
grep -rnoE 'AddParameter\("[^"]+"|api\.digiproject\.uk[^"]*' --include=*.cs DiGi.GIS.WebAPI.UI DiGi.GIS.UI DiGi.GIS.IO | sort -u
```

| Consumer | Where |
|---|---|
| `DiGi.GIS.WebAPI.UI` | every file under `Controllers/`, `Query/`, `Create/` |
| `DiGi.GIS.UI` (desktop) | `DiGi.GIS.UI.Application/Windows/MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `DiGi.GIS.UI/Modify/TryDownload.cs` |
| `DiGi.GIS.IO` | `Modify/Update.cs` (builds an `ortodatas/imagebyreference` URL into a spreadsheet cell) |

Also sweep the front end, which builds its own query strings:
`grep -rnE "fetch\(|\?[a-z]+=" --include=*.js --include=*.cshtml`.

Renaming a parameter is a **breaking wire change**. Prefer adding the new name and accepting both for
one release; when that is not worth it, treat the rename as a deployment step with a client change
landing alongside it.

## 2. Binding traps that fail silently

### An omitted parameter is not a binding failure

`[ApiController]` returns an automatic **400** when a value is present but unparseable — verified
against the deployed host: `administrativearealtype=` → 400, `administrativearealtype=Nonsense` → 400.
It does **not** fire when the parameter is **absent**. An absent simple-type parameter simply keeps
`default(T)`: `0` for `int`, `0.0` for `double`, `false` for `bool`, `(T)0` for an enum.

> **If "absent" must be distinguishable from a legitimate value, bind the parameter as nullable and
> reject `null` explicitly.** A non-nullable `double x` cannot tell an omitted coordinate from the
> valid coordinate `0`.

### An enum sentinel that is not `0` makes the obvious guard dead code

`DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL.Enums.AdministrativeArealType` is `Undefined = -1`, `Country = 0`,
`Voivodeship = 1`, `County = 2`, `Municipality = 3`, `Subdivision = 4`. So for a non-nullable binding:

```csharp
// WRONG - never fires for an omitted parameter, which binds to Country (0), not Undefined (-1).
public async Task<IActionResult> GetAsync([FromQuery(Name = "administrativearealtype")] AdministrativeArealType administrativeArealType, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    if (administrativeArealType == AdministrativeArealType.Undefined)
    {
        return BadRequest();
    }
```

Verified against the deployed host: omitting `administrativearealtype` on
`administrativeareal2Dreferencesbyadministrativearealtype` returns a payload **byte-identical** to
passing `administrativearealtype=0`, headed by `Polska`. The caller asked nothing and silently got
countries.

```csharp
// RIGHT - absence is representable, so it can be rejected.
public async Task<IActionResult> GetAsync([FromQuery(Name = "administrativearealtype")] AdministrativeArealType? administrativeArealType, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
{
    if (administrativeArealType is null || administrativeArealType.Value == AdministrativeArealType.Undefined)
    {
        return BadRequest();
    }
```

Keep a nullable binding where the parameter genuinely **is** optional, and let `null` mean "no filter" —
just do not also compare it to the sentinel and imagine that covers the omitted case.

### Send enum values as integers

A client must put the **integer** on the wire, not the member name:
`urlBuilder.AddParameter("administrativearealtype", (int)AdministrativeArealType.County)`. The member
name binds only against a build whose enum spelling matches, and DiGi has already shipped one rename
(`Subdivison` → `Subdivision`) that makes the name a moving target while the integer never moved.
Against the deployed host: `administrativearealtype=Subdivision` and `administrativearealtype=4`
return byte-identical payloads, while the pre-rename `administrativearealtype=Subdivison` is a hard
**400**.

`…ToString()` on the enum is therefore a latent 400 waiting for the next rename — it is what
`DiGi.GIS.UI.Application/Windows/MainWindow.xaml.cs` does today (`AdministrativeArealType.Subdivision.ToString()`),
which works only because that client and the deployed build happen to agree on the spelling right now.
Cast to `int` instead. See [Coding - Deployed WebAPI.md](Coding%20-%20Deployed%20WebAPI.md) §4 and
[Coding - GIS Administrative Data.md](Coding%20-%20GIS%20Administrative%20Data.md) §6.

## 3. Client / proxy structure

A UI that fronts a WebAPI is still a DiGi project: the
[Coding - General.md](Coding%20-%20General.md) architecture applies unchanged. Reference shape:
`DiGi.GIS.WebAPI.UI`.

- **One base URI constant, never a literal.** `Constants.Default.GISWebAPIUri` (plus a
  `…Uri_Development` sibling), with every other URL composed from it —
  `public const string TerrainUri = GISWebAPIUri + "/gis/terrain";`. A literal repeated per call site
  cannot be repointed at another host.
- **HTTP plumbing belongs in `/Query`, not in the controller.** `CreateClient` → `GetAsync` →
  `IsSuccessStatusCode` → `ReadAsStringAsync` → `Core.Convert.ToDiGi<T>` is five lines that must not be
  copied into every action. One public member per file, extension methods on `HttpClient?`:

  | Member | Returns |
  |---|---|
  | `JsonAsync(requestUri, cancellationToken)` | raw body, for verbatim relay |
  | `ItemsAsync<T>(requestUri, cancellationToken)` | `List<T>?` via `Core.Convert.ToDiGi<T>` |
  | `ItemAsync<T>(requestUri, cancellationToken)` | the first item |
  | `PostJsonAsync<T>(requestUri, value, cancellationToken)` | raw body, for body-criteria endpoints |

  `T` is constrained to `Core.Interfaces.ISerializableObject`. The HTTP verb stays in `PostJsonAsync`'s
  name — the verb is the only thing distinguishing it from its sibling — matching the existing
  `DiGi.WebAPI.Query.GetAsync` precedent, and this is the recognised exception to the
  no-verb-prefix rule for `Query`.
- **Collapse every failure to `null` and let the caller decide.** A page is assembled from several
  independent requests; one of them failing must leave the rest of the page standing. The controller
  then maps `null` to `NoContent()`, which the front end already treats as "hide this panel". Do not
  map an upstream 500 to `BadRequest()` — it blames the caller for a server fault and turns a hidden
  panel into a console error.
- **Do not reuse `DiGi.WebAPI.Query.GetAsync<T>` for this.** It throws on any non-2xx status and takes
  no `CancellationToken` (it derives one from `PostOptions.Delay`), so it fits a background task, not a
  page that must degrade.
- **`CancellationToken` on every action that issues an outbound request**, last parameter (CA1068),
  threaded all the way through. Without it a browser that navigates away leaves the outbound request
  running to completion.

## 4. Do not build on an endpoint that is not deployed yet

The deployed host lags the repository, so an endpoint that exists in source may still answer **404**.
Check what is actually running before writing a client against it:

```bash
# Check deployed controller builds and commit hashes
curl -s "https://api.digiproject.uk/information/controllers"

# Check exact active routes and parameter names (including unlisted endpoints)
curl -s "https://api.digiproject.uk/information/endpoints?includeignored=true"
```

`InformationalVersion` carries the commit hash. Compare it with `git log` for the controller you need.
Querying `/information/endpoints` confirms whether the specific action route, HTTP verb, and query parameter names match what your client expects.

When a client must ship before the endpoint does, gate the call and mark it with a grep-able
`TODO [MarkerName]` per the temporary-code rule in
[Coding - General.md](Coding%20-%20General.md) §1, stating the **observable** removal condition —
"once `GET /information/controllers` reports a build carrying `idsbycode`" — not merely that the code
is temporary.

## 5. Checklist

**Changing a controller**
- [ ] Renamed or removed a `[FromQuery(Name = "…")]`? Grep every client and the front-end query strings.
- [ ] Non-nullable parameter whose absence matters? Make it nullable and reject `null`.
- [ ] Enum guard compared against a sentinel that is not `0`? It does not cover the omitted case.
- [ ] `CancellationToken` last, and actually passed to the converter/query beneath.

**Writing a client**
- [ ] Base URI from a constant; no literal host anywhere else.
- [ ] Request/deserialize through the `/Query` helpers, not inline in the action.
- [ ] Enum values sent as integers.
- [ ] Absence degrades (`NoContent`), it does not fail the page.
- [ ] Every endpoint used is present on the deployed host, or gated behind a `TODO [MarkerName]`.
