# DiGi.YOLO.ONNX

**DiGi.YOLO.ONNX** scores the frozen YOLO detector in process, from an ONNX export, with no Python
interpreter involved. It is the in-process counterpart of `DiGi.YOLO`'s CPython runner and writes
the same bounding box result file, so everything downstream reads one path exactly as it reads the
other.

---

## 🏗️ Project Architecture & Assemblies

The repository contains the following core components and assemblies:
* **[DiGi.YOLO.ONNX](DiGi.YOLO.ONNX)** (Path: `DiGi.YOLO.ONNX\DiGi.YOLO.ONNX`)

It is a companion of [DiGi.YOLO](https://github.com/ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.YOLO) rather than part of
it, so that `DiGi.YOLO` keeps its dependency set — `DiGi.Core` and `System.Text.Json` — and only a
host that actually wants in-process inference pays for ONNX Runtime and OpenCV.

---

## 🤖 What it does

```
image files ──► Emgu.CV decode + letterbox ──► ONNX Runtime ──► NMS ──► .bbrf
```

| | |
|---|---|
| Inference | ONNX Runtime, through `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Managed` |
| Decoding, resizing, padding | Emgu.CV 4.12.0.5764 |
| Output | the same `.bbrf` contract `DiGi.YOLO` writes and reads |

**Emgu.CV is not an arbitrary imaging choice.** It is the same OpenCV that ultralytics calls through
`cv2` — the same JPEG decoder and the same bilinear resize — so the two paths differ only in the
arithmetic of the graph, not in what was fed into it. That is what makes the agreement measured
below reachable at all.

**ONNX Runtime rather than OpenCV's own DNN module**, which Emgu also exposes and which would have
cost no extra package: `Emgu.CV.runtime.windows.cuda` is published on nuget.org only up to
`4.4.0.4099`, and the workspace is on `4.12`. OpenCV DNN through Emgu is therefore CPU-only for the
foreseeable future, while ONNX Runtime reaches a GPU by swapping one native package.

### The native execution provider is the host's choice

This library declares the **managed** bindings only. Each deployed host declares the native provider
it wants, at the same version — `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime` for CPU, `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.DirectML`
for any DirectX 12 GPU without a CUDA install, or `Microsoft.ML.OnnxRuntime.Gpu` for CUDA — along
with `Emgu.CV` and `Emgu.CV.runtime.windows`. A `HintPath` reference does not carry NuGet packages
with it, and the symptom of forgetting is a partial result rather than an error.

---

## 📦 Producing the model

The ONNX file is a **one-off preparation step that still needs ultralytics**, so removing the Python
dependency removes it from every run rather than from the repository. `DiGi.YOLO`'s `export.py`
produces it, and must be run with the version that wrote the checkpoint — `ultralytics==8.3.130` —
or the exported graph is a different detector.

```bash
python export.py --model "user files/YOLO/models/model.pt" --output "user files/YOLO/models/model.onnx"
```

The provenance of the artefact it produces is recorded in the
[DiGi.YOLO README](https://github.com/ZiolkowskiJakub/DiGi.YOLO#readme), beside the checkpoint's own.

---

## ✅ Measured agreement with the CPython path

The detector is frozen, so this path is not allowed to be a slightly different detector. Agreement
is measured rather than assumed, by `DiGi.Test/DiGi.YOLO.ONNX.xUnit`'s `Predict_Parity` fact: both
runners are pointed at one directory of held images and their two `.bbrf` files are compared
detection by detection.

### The stated tolerance

| Bound | Stated | Observed over 2 000 held images |
|---|---|---|
| Images agreeing on detection count | ≥ 99.5 % | **100 %** (2 000 of 2 000) |
| Confident detections with no partner | 0 | **0** |
| 99th percentile box deviation | ≤ 0.1 px | **0.034 px** (median 0.004 px) |
| Overlap of any matched pair | ≥ 0.95 | **0.970** |
| Confidence deviation | ≤ 0.01 | **0.001062** |

The tolerance is not zero and cannot be: one path runs an fp32 CUDA graph through torch and the
other an fp32 graph through ONNX Runtime, so the last bits of every number differ. A detection whose
confidence sits on the reporting threshold legitimately appears on one side and not the other, so
detections inside a guard band around the threshold are left out of the count comparison rather than
counted as disagreements.

**Coordinates are bounded at a percentile rather than at a maximum, on purpose.** Measured: 2 of
1 639 matched detections move by more than a pixel, the worst by 3.3 px — and that one had its
confidence agreeing to 1e-5 with exactly one detection on each side, so it is not a suppression tie
and it is not a systematic shift either (the median is 0.004 px). The explanation that fits, though
it has not been proven by instrumenting the graph: YOLOv8 regresses each box edge as a softmax
expectation over sixteen bins measured in units of the feature stride, and that expectation is far
more sensitive to the last bits than the single sigmoid the class score comes from, so an edge can
move a fraction of a bin — several pixels at stride 32 — while the score does not move at all. Bounding the maximum would mean stating a tolerance of about 4 px, and a 4 px bound
would no longer notice a real coordinate regression against a median of 0.004 px. Every individual
detection is instead guarded by the overlap of its matched pair, which stays high however the edges
wander.

### Throughput, for the record

The CPython path reaches **12.8 ms/image** on CUDA in steady state. The ONNX path on the **CPU**
execution provider takes **177 ms/image** — this is a 68-million-parameter network at 640×640, so
that is expected rather than surprising, and it is why the pipeline default was left on CPython.
Making the in-process path fast is a separate question of choosing a GPU execution provider, and is
deliberately not answered here.

## 💻 Coding Guidelines for Developers & AI Agents

To maintain codebase health, performance, and compatibility within Visual Studio 2026 / C# 10+ environments, all developers and AI agents must strictly comply with these guidelines.

### 1. General Coding Standards
1. **English only** — identifiers and comments.
2. **Explicit typing — no `var`** (unless the compiler forces it, e.g. anonymous types). Use target-typed `new(...)` when the type is declared (avoids IDE0090): `PointNode pointNode = new();`. Use collection expressions `[]` for collections (avoids IDE0028): `List<int> numbers = [];`, `int[] array = [1, 2, 3];`.
3. **Variable naming:** start with the type name in camelCase, adding a `_`-suffixed qualifier when needed (`PointNode pointNode_Base`, `pointNode_Temp`).
   - **Collections:** don't prefix with the collection type — use the element type pluralized (`FilterConditions`, not `Conditions`/`listConditions`; `FilterGroups`, not `Groups`/`listGroups`).
   - **Property matching its value type:** if a value type is fully descriptive and unique in the class, name the property after the type (`public AggregateFunction AggregateFunction { get; set; }`).
   - **Primitives** may use plain camelCase (`double tolerance`, `string name`, `int count`).
4. **Zero warnings/analyzer messages** — nullability, parameter validation, clean code.
5. **C# 10+ / C# 13/14** (`LangVersion` ≥ 10) — modern features (enhanced pattern matching, target-typed `new`, collection expressions, `System.Threading.Lock`, etc.) are fine within these architectural constraints. **Namespaces must be block-scoped** (as in every example below); file-scoped namespaces are disallowed and enforced via `.editorconfig` (`csharp_style_namespace_declarations = block_scoped`). See `Coding - Editor Config.md` for the unified baseline rules.
6. **Parameter Line Breaks (`<= 7` Rule):** If a method, constructor, or delegate declaration has 7 or fewer parameters, keep them on a single line however long the line becomes. Multi-line parameter lists are reserved for 8 or more parameters (strictly one parameter per line, enforced via `DIGI0001`). Call sites prefer single-line but allow multi-line formatting when arguments are complex expressions, lambdas, or object initializers.
   - **Correct (<= 7 parameters):**
     ```csharp
     public void Calculate(double centerX, double centerY, double radius, double? storeyHeight = null)
     {
     }
     ```
   - **Incorrect (<= 7 parameters):**
     ```csharp
     public void Calculate(
         double centerX,
         double centerY,
         double radius,
         double? storeyHeight = null)
     {
     }
     ```
   - **Correct (>= 8 parameters, one per line):**
     ```csharp
     public void Calculate(
         double centerX,
         double centerY,
         double radius,
         double? storeyHeight,
         double wallThickness,
         double slabThickness,
         string materialName,
         CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
     {
     }
     ```
7. **Async method naming:** All asynchronous method names must end with `Async`.
   - **Example:**
     ```csharp
     public async Task<IActionResult> GetDetailsByReferenceAsync([FromQuery(Name = "reference")] string? reference)
     ```
8. **`CancellationToken` is always the LAST parameter (CA1068).** This holds for every method — public, private, static, extension, local — and for every overload. When adding a new optional parameter to an existing signature, insert it *before* the token; never append after it.
   - **Correct:**
     ```csharp
     public static async Task<bool> ClearAsync(NpgsqlConnection? npgsqlConnection, string tableName, int commandTimeout = 30, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default)
     ```
   - **Incorrect** — appending after the token is the usual way this rule gets broken:
     ```csharp
     public static async Task<bool> ClearAsync(NpgsqlConnection? npgsqlConnection, string tableName, CancellationToken cancellationToken = default, int commandTimeout = 30)
     ```
   - The `<param>` tags in the XML doc block must be reordered to match, so the docs still mirror the signature exactly.
   - **Pass the token by name at call sites** — `cancellationToken: cancellationToken` — whenever intervening parameters are left at their defaults. Positional calls silently rebind if the signature is ever reordered again; named arguments turn a reordering into a compile error rather than a wrong-argument bug.
   - **Detection:** `grep -rnE "CancellationToken [a-zA-Z_]+( = default)?, " --include=*.cs .` — every hit that is not the final parameter is a violation.
9. **Simplify member access (IDE0002/IDE0001) — but verify the binding first.** Inside the `DiGi` root, drop any namespace qualifier the compiler does not need; a `DiGi.` prefix on a type that already resolves is redundant noise.
   - **Correct** — in `namespace DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL.UI.Classes`, `Serilog` resolves up the enclosing chain to `DiGi.Serilog`:
     ```csharp
     Serilog.Modify.Log(Serilog.Enums.LogEventLevel.Error, "Import failed");
     ```
   - **The exception — innermost-namespace shadowing.** C# resolves the FIRST segment against each enclosing namespace from innermost outwards, and once it binds there is **no fallback**. From `DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL.UI.Classes`, `WebAPI` binds to `DiGi.GIS.WebAPI` (not `DiGi.WebAPI`), so the qualifier must stay:
     ```csharp
     postResponse = await DiGi.WebAPI.Query.GetAsync<Building>(httpClient, requestUri, postOptions);
     ```
     The same trap applies to `Core`, `Geometry`, `Analytical` and any other segment that repeats at several depths.
   - **Method:** remove the qualifier, then **rebuild**. A shadowed name usually fails with CS0234/CS0246 — restore the prefix and leave a short comment saying why. Never shorten a qualifier you have not compiled. If BOTH namespaces expose a matching member, the shortened form compiles and silently calls the wrong one — keep the qualifier regardless of the analyzer suggestion.
10. **Project Structure:** Assume the C# codebase consists of multiple SEPARATE projects, not a single monolithic solution. Handle namespaces and references accordingly.
11. **Output Optimization:** Prioritize highest code quality and output token minimization. Skip conversational filler, polite introductions, and conclusions. Output only the necessary code, logic, or requested explanations.
12. **Temporary code markers:** code that exists only until a migration completes is tagged `TODO [MarkerName]:` at every site, where `MarkerName` is PascalCase and names the migration rather than the issue (`[ReferenceFormat]`, `[ReferencedObjectIndexes]`) — one tag reused everywhere, so `grep -rn "MarkerName"` returns the whole deletion checklist.
   - Every marker states its **removal condition**: the observable fact that makes deletion safe ("once every deployed database has run this DDL at least once"), not just that the code is temporary. Name the tracking issue when there is one.
   - Inline comment at the site; file header above the `using` block when the whole file is temporary (`DiGi.Core/Query/TryParseLegacy.cs`); `[TEMPORARY]` as the first token of the XML `<summary>` when removing a whole public member would be a public-API change (`DiGi.GIS.WebAPI.UI/Controllers/SolarController.cs`).
   - Mark only what is actually temporary — permanent code shipped alongside it must not carry the tag.
13. **`ToString()` is not a key.** `Range<T>.ToString()` and `$"[{min}, {max}]"` follow `CurrentCulture`, so a dictionary keyed on them files `[0,5, 12,25]` under pl-PL and nothing throws. Anything used as an identity - a dictionary key, a stored reference, a hash input - renders through `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` (`"R"` for floating point with `-0.0` folded, `G29` for decimal, ticks for `DateTime`); `DiGi.Typology.Visual.Query.Key` is the reference renderer and its fact re-runs the assertions under `pl-PL`. An `object`-typed value comes back from a JSON reload as `double`, so such a key must also be width-agnostic.
14. **A member resolved by name through reflection is a contract on the whole hierarchy.** `Typology.Query.RuleData` calls `GetMethod(nameof(RuleData))`, which silently forbids any derived rule from hiding `RuleData` with `new`. Document such a lookup at the reflection site and on the base type, prefer a non-generic interface member while the design is open, and probe `GetMethod` behaviour with a scratch app rather than reasoning about it.

### 2. Architecture & Project Structure (DiGi.Core Pattern)
Data models are strictly separated from business logic (anemic models + static extension methods). Follow this structure for all new features.

**Data models:**
- **Classes** → `/Classes`, ns `[Project].Classes` — lightweight (properties + basic constructors only), **no** complex logic.
- **Interfaces** → `/Interfaces`, ns `[Project].Interfaces`.
- **Enums** → `/Enums`, ns `[Project].Enums`.

**Business logic** — all complex behavior is an extension method in one of static partial classes; never create a manager/service class:
- **`Query`** (`/Query`) — returns a result from a query; does NOT modify the source (e.g. translating dynamic filter groups into SQL/parameterized commands).
- **`Modify`** (`/Modify`) — modifies the state/properties of the existing object.
- **`Create`** (`/Create`) — creates and returns a completely new object from input data.
- **`Convert`** (`/Convert`, subdirs `/Convert/To[TargetArea]` e.g. `/Convert/ToSystem`, `/Convert/ToEPW`, `/Convert/ToDiGi`) — converts/formats/transforms an object or raw components into another representation; method names follow `To[TargetArea]_[TargetType]` (`ToSystem_String`, `ToSystem_DateTime`, `ToEPW_DateTime`).

### Exception — interface-contract members are implemented ON the class
The anemic-model + static-extension rule governs behavior that is **not** part of an interface the `/Classes` type implements. When a method is declared on an interface the class implements, it MUST be a normal **instance method on that class** — C# offers no other way to satisfy the contract, and moving it to a `Query`/`Modify` extension leaves the interface unimplemented (CS0535).

This is the deliberate design for **behavior-rich geometry primitives**. `DiGi.Geometry`'s `Ellipse2D`, `Circle2D`, `Segment2D`, `Polygon2D`, `Rectangle2D`, their spatial counterparts, etc. implement rich behavioral interfaces and therefore carry their behavior as instance methods — for example `IBoundable2D.GetBoundingBox()`, `ITransformable2D.Transform(...)`, `IMovable2D.Move(...)`, and `IClosedCurve2D.{GetInternalPoint, InRange, Inside, GetArea}`. These types are **not** anemic, and that is correct.

- **Do not "migrate" a geometry primitive's instance methods to `Query`/`Modify` extensions, and do not flag them as anemic-model violations.** Deleting a contract implementation breaks the interface and diverges from the entire library.
- **Before proposing to move or remove such a method, check the interface chain first** (the `I*2D` hierarchy under `Planar/Interfaces` / `Spatial/Interfaces`). Only behavior that is genuinely not a contract member — and that belongs to a data model rather than a geometry primitive — goes into the static partial classes.
- **Private helpers are allowed on such a class.** The "strictly avoid private methods" rule below is scoped to the static partial utility classes (`Query`/`Modify`/`Create`/`Convert`), not to `/Classes` types that implement behavioral interfaces.

### Constructors stay cheap — the work belongs in a `Create` factory
**A constructor on a `/Classes` type assigns and clones. Nothing else.** No validation sweep, no normalisation, no cleanup pass, no geometric or numeric computation — not even an `O(n)` scan over a collection the caller just handed over. A constructor sits on the hot path of every clone, every copy constructor and every deserialization, and a caller who already holds clean data must not pay for a check it does not need.

- **Any such work goes into a `Create` factory** named after the type it returns, at `/Create/[TypeName].cs`. The factory does the work, then calls the plain constructor. It returns the type as **nullable** and returns `null` when the input cannot make a valid object — the guard is a return value, not an exception.
- **Order inside the factory:** materialise and filter the input → run the cleanup → *then* check the result is still valid. Validating before the cleanup measures the wrong thing: a ring of three positions that repeats a corner passes a "three or more" check and then becomes a two-corner polygon.
- **Document the split on both sides.** The constructor's `<summary>` points at the factory for callers whose data is not already clean; the factory's `<summary>` says what it removes and why the constructor does not.

Reference: `DiGi.Geometry.Planar.Create.Polygon2D(IEnumerable<Point2D?>?, double)` and `DiGi.Geometry.Spatial.Create.Polygon3D(IEnumerable<Point3D?>?, double)` both drop points repeating their predecessor via `Modify.RemoveDuplicates(..., closed, tolerance)` *before* checking the corner count, while `Polygon2D`'s constructors store whatever they are given.

```csharp
// /Classes — plain assignment, no work
public Polygon2D(IEnumerable<Point2D>? point2Ds)
    : base(point2Ds)
{
}

// /Create — the work lives here, and the guard runs after it
public static Polygon2D? Polygon2D(this IEnumerable<Point2D?>? point2Ds, double tolerance = DiGi.Core.Constants.Tolerance.Distance)
{
    if (point2Ds == null)
    {
        return null;
    }

    List<Point2D> point2Ds_Temp = [];
    foreach (Point2D? point2D in point2Ds)
    {
        if (point2D != null)
        {
            point2Ds_Temp.Add(point2D);
        }
    }

    point2Ds_Temp.RemoveDuplicates(true, tolerance);

    if (point2Ds_Temp.Count < 3)
    {
        return null;
    }

    return new Polygon2D(point2Ds_Temp);
}
```

### File organisation — one member per file
- **`Query`/`Modify`/`Create` hold exactly one public method per file, and the file is named after that method** (`/Spatial/Query/NearestIndexes.cs` holds `NearestIndexes`). Do **not** group related methods into one file — `TryGetNearestIndexes`, `NearestIndexes` and `NearestNeighbors` are three files, not one.
  - **Overloads are the same method and stay together.** Every `Triangle3D(...)` overload lives in `Triangle3D.cs`; the plural `Triangle3Ds(...)` is a different method name and gets `Triangle3Ds.cs`.
  - A helper promoted to `public static` under the encapsulation rule below gets its own file too, named after the helper.
  - **`Convert` is the exception** and keeps its file-per-TARGET-type layout, `/Convert/To[TargetArea]/[TargetType].cs`.
- **Nested types get their own file, `[Outer].[Inner].cs`**, beside the outer type's file, carrying only the nested type and declaring the outer type `partial` — `/Spatial/Classes/PointCloud3D.Point.cs` and `/Spatial/Classes/PointCloud3D.Enumerator.cs` sit next to `/Spatial/Classes/PointCloud3D.cs`. Keep the type nested; promoting it to top level changes the public API and the bare name rarely stands alone (`Point`, `Enumerator`). The repeated outer `partial` declaration carries no XML `<summary>`, per the "do not document `partial` class declarations" rule.

### Method Encapsulation and Reusability in Utility Classes
- **Strictly avoid creating private methods** within `Query`, `Convert`, `Modify`, and similar partial utility classes.
- If a helper method has well-defined inputs, no side effects, and high reusability, implement it as a **public static method** within the appropriate partial class (e.g., `Query`, `Convert`, `Modify`).
- If a helper method is strictly single-use or specific to a narrow scope, implement it as a **local function (inline method)** directly inside the method you are currently implementing.

### Convert Class Pattern (conversion methods)
`public static partial class Convert` is the **first choice** for any method that transforms an object into another representation — including performance-oriented variants that avoid defensive cloning. Never implement a conversion as an instance method on a `/Classes` model; model classes stay anemic.

The pattern, as established across the `Convert` folders (reference: `DiGi.Geometry/Planar/Convert`):

- **Folder/file layout:** `/Convert/To[TargetArea]/[TargetType].cs` — one file per TARGET type, named after the target type; all source-type overloads converting to that target live in that file (e.g. `ToNTS/LinearRing.cs`, `ToDiGi/Polygon2D.cs`, `ToNTS/Coordinates.cs`).
- **Method shape:** `public static` **extension method on the SOURCE type**; reference-type parameters are nullable; return `null` for null/invalid input instead of throwing.
- **Naming:** plain `To[TargetArea](...)` when the source type has a single natural target in that area — the target is then distinguished by the source overload (`ToNTS(this Point2D?)` → `Coordinate`, `ToNTS(this Segment2D?)` → `LineSegment`, `ToNTS(this IPolygonal2D?)` → `LinearRing`). Use the suffixed form `To[TargetArea]_[TargetType](...)` when the same source converts to several targets in one area (`ToNTS_LineString(this Segment2D?)` and `ToNTS_Polygon(this IPolygonal2D?)` beside the plain overloads above; `ToDiGi_Polygon2Ds(this Polygon?)` beside `ToDiGi(this Polygon?)` → `PolygonalFace2D`).

### Naming Conventions for Query Partial Class
- Enforce a property-like naming convention for methods inside the `Query` class.
- **Do not use verbs as prefixes** (e.g., avoid `Get`, `Find`, `Calculate`).
  - *Example:* `GetBoundingBox()` must be named `BoundingBox()`.
- **Exceptions:** Verbs indicating boolean checks or safe-retrieval patterns are required. Allowed prefixes are `Is`, `Has`, and `Try`.
  - *Examples:* `IsPlanar()`, `HasMaterial()`, `TryConvert()`.

## Project assets — `files/` vs `user files/` (NEVER commit secrets)
Runtime assets a project copies to its output belong in one of two solution-root folders, chosen by
sensitivity. **Secrets, credentials and machine-specific configuration MUST go in `user files/`,
never in `files/`.** Both are copied to the build output by a `.csproj` target; the difference is git.

- **`files/`** — committed to source control. Non-sensitive, environment-agnostic deployment assets
  shared by everyone (e.g. `web.config`, `app_offline.htm.bak`). Copied by a `CopyFiles` target:
  ```xml
  <Target Name="CopyFiles" AfterTargets="Build">
    <ItemGroup>
      <_Files Include="$(ProjectDir)..\files\**\*.*" />
    </ItemGroup>
    <Copy SourceFiles="@(_Files)" DestinationFiles="@(_Files->'$(OutputPath)%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')" SkipUnchangedFiles="true" />
  </Target>
  ```
- **`user files/`** — git-**ignored**. Fragile / user-specific / secret data: database connection
  configs (`*.conf` with host/user/password), API keys, local paths, per-machine settings. Copied by
  a `CopyUserFiles` target specifying `AfterTargets="CopyFiles"` so user files overwrite any duplicates
  copied by `CopyFiles`:
  ```xml
  <Target Name="CopyUserFiles" AfterTargets="CopyFiles">
    <ItemGroup>
      <_UserFiles Include="$(ProjectDir)..\user files\**\*.*" />
    </ItemGroup>
    <Copy SourceFiles="@(_UserFiles)" DestinationFiles="@(_UserFiles->'$(OutputPath)%(RecursiveDir)%(Filename)%(Extension)')" SkipUnchangedFiles="true" />
  </Target>
  ```
  - **Generated output also belongs here.** Test reports, diagnostic dumps, benchmark logs and text
    logs written during a run go to `user files/reports/` — never to `files/`. In tests, resolve the
    folder with `assembly.ReportsDirectory()` rather than a hardcoded path (see §7).

**Overriding Rule:** In case of duplicate relative file paths between `files/` and `user files/`, assets from `user files/` MUST ALWAYS take precedence and override assets from `files/`. Specifying `AfterTargets="CopyFiles"` ensures `CopyUserFiles` runs strictly after `CopyFiles` to overwrite any duplicates.

**Enforcement:** the solution-root `.gitignore` must contain the case-insensitive rule
`[Uu]ser [Ff]iles/`. Verify with `git check-ignore -v "user files/<file>"` — git must report the rule
as the reason the file is ignored. If a new solution needs runtime secrets and lacks this rule, add
it before dropping any secret in. Reference implementations: `DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL.UI`,
`DiGi.GIS.PostgreSQL.WebAPI` (both hold `GIS_PostgreSQL_Main.conf` in an ignored `user files/`).

**Decision rule when placing a runtime asset:** would committing it leak a secret, or break another
developer's / the server's machine-specific setup? If yes → `user files/`; otherwise → `files/`.

- **Script configurations (PowerShell)**: PowerShell scripts requiring machine-specific, secret, or environment-specific paths (e.g., local backup paths or cloud storage directories) must load these settings from a `.conf` file inside the `user files/` directory, rather than hardcoding them in the scripts or introducing custom `.gitignore` records.

## Host dependencies — `HintPath` drops a library's NuGet packages

DiGi projects reference each other with `<Reference><HintPath>..\..\X\bin\X.dll</HintPath>`, never
`<ProjectReference>`. A raw assembly reference is **opaque to NuGet**, and the DiGi class libraries do
not copy their own NuGet dependencies into their `bin` — so a library's third-party dependencies never
reach a host that consumes it by `HintPath`.

> **When a `HintPath`-referenced library needs a NuGet package, re-declare that `PackageReference` on
> the deployed host (the `Exe` / `WinExe` / `Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web` project) at the identical version.**

- The chain runs deeper than the direct reference: `DiGi.Geometry` → `DiGi.Math` → `MathNet.Numerics`.
  Audit the whole closure, not just the assemblies listed in the `.csproj`.
- Do **NOT** use `CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies=true` on the netstandard2.0 library — it bloats its `bin`
  with `System.*` 4.3.0 shims.
- `<ProjectReference>` consumers (siblings, `.xUnit`, `.Rhino`) are unaffected; NuGet flows normally.

**The failure signature is a partial result, not an error.** `FileNotFoundException` is thrown per item
deep inside a loop, so a batch run completes and reports success while silently delivering less than it
should — one county produced models for 65 % of 33 687 buildings and reported success. A green build and
a green test suite prove nothing, because the `.xUnit` projects re-declare these packages themselves.
**When a run completes but delivers less than it should, check the host's output directory for missing
assemblies before investigating the data.**

**Extension hosts are one probing set.** `DiGi.GIS.WebAPI`, `DiGi.GLTF.WebAPI`, `DiGi.Communication.WebAPI`
and `DiGi.User.WebAPI` deploy into `DiGi.WebAPI.WindowsService\bin\extensions\<name>` and are loaded into
`AssemblyLoadContext.Default` with cross-directory `AssemblyDependencyResolver`s. Audit the host output
**together with** its `extensions\*` folders, and declare a shared dependency once on
`DiGi.WebAPI.WindowsService` — that is already how `Microsoft.OpenApi` and `Serilog` reach the extensions.

Verify after building — both read compiled output, not project files:
```powershell
PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\CheckHostDependencies.ps1"
```
```powershell
PowerShell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File ".\BuildAll.ps1" -Configuration Release -CheckDependencies
```
Each deployment unit declares its reviewed exceptions inside `CheckHostDependencies.ps1`, every one with a
stated reason — an unexplained entry there re-hides the exact class of bug the script exists to find.

---

### 3. Reference Comparison (`IReference` / `IUniqueReference`)

> **Never compare two interface-typed references with `==` or `!=`. Use `Core.Query.Equals(reference_1, reference_2)`.**

This is not a style preference. `==` between two interface-typed operands compiles to **reference equality**, silently returns `false` for two equal references, and the compiler emits no warning. It has already produced an infinite loop in `BuildingModelShellUpdater` and mis-attributed geometry in `ShellByPlaneSplitSolver`.

**Why the operators do not apply.** For `a == b`, C# gathers user-defined operator candidates from the **static types of the operands and their base classes** — an interface contributes none. The `==`/`!=` operators live on `SerializableReference`, so the comparison is correct as soon as **one** side is a concrete `SerializableReference`-derived type (or the `null` literal).

| Static type of the operands | What `==` compiles to | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| both interfaces (`IReference`, `IUniqueReference`, `ISerializableReference`, …) | predefined reference equality | **silent bug** |
| at least one `SerializableReference`-derived (`GuidReference`, `TypeReference`, …) | `SerializableReference.operator ==` → `Equals` | correct |
| one side is the `null` literal | null check | correct |
| `.ToString()` on both sides | string comparison | correct, but allocates |

This cannot be fixed by adding operators: interfaces contribute no operator candidates, a `operator ==(IReference, IReference)` declared in a helper class is **CS0563**, and C# 11 static abstract interface operators dispatch only through a constrained generic type parameter (and require net7.0+, while `DiGi.Core` targets `netstandard2.0`).

**The compounding trap — clone-per-call accessors.** Many model properties return `Core.Query.Clone(field)` and therefore hand back a **new instance on every read**, so `face.UniqueReference == face.UniqueReference` is `false` — the same face compared with itself. Read the property into a local before using it; never call it inside a predicate that runs per element (it is also an allocation per iteration).

| Intent | Use |
|---|---|
| Are these two references the same reference? | `Core.Query.Equals(reference_1, reference_2)` (null-safe, two nulls are equal) |
| Look up / group / de-duplicate | `Dictionary`, `HashSet`, `List.Find`/`FindAll`/`FindIndex`/`Contains` — already correct, they route through `Equals`/`GetHashCode` |
| I need the concrete API | pattern-match: `if (uniqueReference is GuidReference guidReference)` |
| Is this the same *instance* of a model object? | compare its `Guid` — a reference identifies the referenced object, not the object holding it |

```csharp
// WRONG - both operands are IUniqueReference, this is reference equality and never matches
int index = faces.FindIndex(x => x.UniqueReference == face.UniqueReference);
```

```csharp
// CORRECT - hoist the clone-returning accessor into a local, then compare by value
IUniqueReference? uniqueReference = face.UniqueReference;

int index = faces.FindIndex(x => Core.Query.Equals(x?.UniqueReference, uniqueReference));
```

**Do not assume an `IReference` is a `SerializableReference` — never cast to it.** `ListClusterReference<TKey_1, TKey_2>` implements `IReference` directly, and `IUniqueReference` has two class branches (`UniqueReference` and `UniqueExternalReference<T>`) with no common base below `SerializableReference`.

### 4. XML Documentation Standards
All public constructors, properties, methods, and enum values must be fully documented using XML comments:
* **Code preservation & sync:** Edit only `///` comments — never change C# logic. Add missing tags, and rewrite any existing comment that is outdated, inaccurate, or describes logic/parameters that no longer exist.
* **Explicit typing:** No `var` in any code snippet you touch.
* **Partial classes:** Don't document the class declaration itself when marked `partial`; document only its members.
* **Exhaustive coverage:** Every public member must have an accurate, up-to-date description.
* **Quality over speed** — prioritize accuracy and alignment with the code's actual behavior.
* **Reference context:** For each referenced library, ingest its sibling XML doc file (`LibraryName.dll` → `LibraryName.xml`, same directory) for accurate cross-referencing, terminology, and external type/parameter descriptions.
* **Signature matching:** Docs must match signatures exactly — remove `<param>` tags for parameters that no longer exist, add tags for new ones. Document all `<param>`, `<returns>`, and `<typeparam>` to avoid CS1591/CS1573.
* **Single summary:** Exactly one `<summary>` per element. When updating, overwrite the old one — never append. Do a final pass to strip any redundant tags.
* **No empty lines** inside doc blocks (no blank line or bare `///`) — they break Visual Studio IntelliSense tooltip rendering. Use `<para>` for paragraph breaks:

   ```csharp
   // INCORRECT — a blank line splits the block
   /// <summary>
   /// Calculates the total volume of the selected Revit elements.

   /// This operation might take a while on large BIM models.
   /// </summary>

   // CORRECT — use <para>
   /// <summary>
   /// Calculates the total volume of the selected Revit elements.
   /// <para>This operation might take a while on large BIM models.</para>
   /// </summary>
   ```

### 5. API Reference Documentation Locating
To minimize token consumption and avoid parsing full implementation files, you MUST consult the generated Markdown documentation first when exploring type schemas, namespaces, and public API interfaces:
To save tokens, consult the generated Markdown API docs before parsing `.cs` source when exploring type schemas, namespaces, or public API.

- **Path:** `documentation/API/[AssemblyName]/` in each active workspace — one directory per assembly, split by **namespace** (e.g. `DiGi.Core.Classes.md`). These files hold exact signatures and `<summary>` descriptions for all public classes, constructors, methods, properties, and enums.
- **Fallback:** if `documentation/API/` is absent, scan the C# source and `/bin/*.xml` files.

### 6. Serialization Pattern (SerializableObject / ISerializableObject)
Classes under `/Classes` needing JSON persistence, cloning, or polymorphic deserialization MUST inherit `DiGi.Core.Classes.SerializableObject` in this exact shape (reflection-driven — no manual JSON parsing).

1. **Marker interfaces** per project under `/Interfaces` (mirroring `DiGi.GIS.Interfaces.IGISObject`/`IGISSerializableObject`):
   ```csharp
   // /Interfaces/I<Project>Object.cs
   public interface I<Project>Object : DiGi.Core.Interfaces.IObject
   {
   }

   // /Interfaces/I<Project>SerializableObject.cs
   public interface I<Project>SerializableObject : I<Project>Object, DiGi.Core.Interfaces.ISerializableObject
   {
   }
   ```
   Every serializable class implements `I<Project>SerializableObject` (e.g. `public class Holiday : SerializableObject, IEPWSerializableObject`).
2. **Fields:** `private readonly`, each `[JsonInclude, JsonPropertyName(nameof(PublicPropertyName))]` — always `nameof(...)`, never a hardcoded string literal.
3. **Three constructors, always in this order:**
   - **Primary** (plain params, assigns fields) — no `base(...)` call needed.
   - **Copy** `ClassName(ClassName? classNameInstance) : base(classNameInstance)`, copying every field:
     - Primitive/value-type fields and strings: copy by value.
     - `List<T>`/`IList<T>` of **primitives**: `new List<T>(source)` (or `null` if source is `null`).
     - `IList<T>` of **nested `SerializableObject`-derived items**: clone element-by-element filtering nulls (see the excerpt below). Do NOT pipe the `IEnumerable<T>.Clone<T>()` extension into an `IList<T>` field — it returns `List<T?>?`, a nullable-element mismatch against a non-nullable `IList<T>` field.
     - A single nested `SerializableObject` reference: `field = Core.Query.Clone(source.field);`.
   - **JSON** `ClassName(JsonObject? jsonObject) : base(jsonObject)` — pure delegation, empty body.
4. **Properties:** `[JsonIgnore]` get-only, returning the backing field (the field attribute handles serialization — do not also serialize through the property).
5. **Project file:** `.csproj` needs a `<Reference Include="DiGi.Core"><HintPath>..\..\DiGi.Core\bin\DiGi.Core.dll</HintPath></Reference>` and a `<PackageReference Include="System.Text.Json" .../>` matching the version used elsewhere (check `DiGi.Core.csproj`).

### Example — simple class with primitive fields (`/Classes/Holiday.cs`)
```csharp
using DiGi.Core.Classes;
using DiGi.EPW.Interfaces;
using System.Text.Json.Nodes;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

namespace DiGi.EPW.Classes
{
    public class Holiday : SerializableObject, IEPWSerializableObject
    {
        [JsonInclude, JsonPropertyName(nameof(Name))]
        private readonly string? name;

        [JsonInclude, JsonPropertyName(nameof(Date))]
        private readonly string? date;

        public Holiday(string? name, string? date)
        {
            this.name = name;
            this.date = date;
        }

        public Holiday(Holiday? holiday)
            : base(holiday)
        {
            if (holiday != null)
            {
                name = holiday.name;
                date = holiday.date;
            }
        }

        public Holiday(JsonObject? jsonObject)
            : base(jsonObject)
        {
        }

        [JsonIgnore]
        public string? Name
        {
            get
            {
                return name;
            }
        }

        [JsonIgnore]
        public string? Date
        {
            get
            {
                return date;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Example — nested list of `SerializableObject` items (copy-constructor excerpt)
```csharp
public HolidaysDaylightSaving(HolidaysDaylightSaving? holidaysDaylightSaving)
    : base(holidaysDaylightSaving)
{
    if (holidaysDaylightSaving != null)
    {
        leapYearObserved = holidaysDaylightSaving.leapYearObserved;

        if (holidaysDaylightSaving.holidays != null)
        {
            holidays = [];
            foreach (Holiday holiday in holidaysDaylightSaving.holidays)
            {
                if (Core.Query.Clone(holiday) is Holiday holiday_Temp)
                {
                    holidays.Add(holiday_Temp);
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Example — `List<double>` of primitives (copy-constructor excerpt)
```csharp
public GroundTemperature(GroundTemperature? groundTemperature)
    : base(groundTemperature)
{
    if (groundTemperature != null)
    {
        depth = groundTemperature.depth;
        monthlyValues = groundTemperature.monthlyValues == null ? null : new List<double>(groundTemperature.monthlyValues);
    }
}
```

### 7. Automatic Tests (xUnit)
1. **One test project per project:** `[ProjectName].xUnit` (e.g. `DiGi.Core.xUnit`, `DiGi.Geometry.xUnit`).
2. **`public partial class Facts`** holds all test methods (one shared class per namespace).
3. **Files under `/Facts`.**
4. **Namespace matches the test project** (e.g. `namespace DiGi.Core.xUnit`).
5. **`Xunit` is global-usinged** by project config — do NOT add `using Xunit;`.
6. **`[Fact]`** marks test methods.
7. **Name the method** after the class/property/method under test (`Color()`, `PlanarIntersectionResult_Performance()`).
8. **XML `<summary>` on every test** describing what is tested — no empty lines inside the block (they break VS tooltips); use `<para>` for paragraph breaks.

#### 📂 Shared Test Data Files (Fixtures)
When a test needs an on-disk input file (`.gmf`, `.json`, `.epw`, …), use the **one shared `files` directory** — do NOT add a per-project data folder.

1. **Location:** `DiGi.Test/files/` (the `DiGi.Test` repo sits beside the other `DiGi.*` repos under the `DigiProject` workspace root; from a `DiGi.Test/<ProjectName>.xUnit/` dir it is `../files/`). The path is given relative to the workspace root because this guideline lives in the separate `DiGi.Maintenance` repo.
2. **Add a fixture:** drop the file into `DiGi.Test/files/` and reference it by file name only. Files are read **in place** (not copied to build output) — no `<None CopyToOutputDirectory>` entry needed.
3. **Resolve the path:** `Core.xUnit.Query.FilePath(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), "<fileName>")` returns the absolute path to `DiGi.Test/files/<fileName>`; for the directory itself use `assembly.FilesDirectory()`. Both live in `DiGi.Core.xUnit/Query/` (`FilePath.cs`, `FilesDirectory.cs`) and resolve by walking up from the test assembly's `bin/<ProjectName>.xUnit/` output. `FilePath` `Assert`s the directory resolves, so a `null`/missing result fails the test cleanly.
4. **No `using` needed** — call it fully qualified as `Core.xUnit.Query.FilePath(...)`; it resolves via the same innermost-enclosing-namespace lookup as `Core.xUnit.Query.SerializationCheck(...)`, as long as the test namespace nests under `DiGi`. Add `using System.Reflection;` (or fully qualify `Assembly`).
5. **Example:**
   ```csharp
   using System.Reflection;
   // ...
   string? path = Core.xUnit.Query.FilePath(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly(), "0207_GML.gmf");
   Assert.False(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(path));
   Assert.True(System.IO.File.Exists(path));
   ```
   References: `DiGi.GIS.xUnit/Facts/OrtoDatas.cs`, `DiGi.EPW.xUnit/Facts/EPWFile.cs`, `DiGi.Geometry.xUnit/Facts/InRange.cs`.
6. **Large binaries** (multi-MB `.gmf`, etc.) are git-tracked (not ignored) — prefer a representative-but-minimal sample, and consider Git LFS if size becomes a concern.

#### 📄 Test Reports & Diagnostic Outputs
Input fixtures are read from `files/`; everything a test **writes** goes to `DiGi.Test/user files/reports/`.

1. **Rule:** ALL reports, text dumps, benchmark logs and diagnostic output produced during test execution must be written to `user files/reports/` — never to `files/`, and never to a hardcoded machine path. `user files/` is git-ignored, so test output never lands in a commit.
2. **Resolve the folder:** `Core.xUnit.Query.ReportsDirectory(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly())` or `assembly.ReportsDirectory()` (both resolve **and create** `DiGi.Test/user files/reports/`). For the parent folder use `assembly.UserFilesDirectory()`. Helpers live in `DiGi.Core.xUnit/Query/` beside `FilePath.cs` / `FilesDirectory.cs`.
3. **Example:**
   ```csharp
   using System.Reflection;
   // ...
   string? pathReportsDirectory = Core.xUnit.Query.ReportsDirectory(Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly());
   Assert.False(string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(pathReportsDirectory));

   string pathReport = System.IO.Path.Combine(pathReportsDirectory!, "Diagnostic_Report.txt");
   System.IO.File.WriteAllLines(pathReport, reportLines);
   ```
   References: `DiGi.CityGML.xUnit/Facts/InspectDuplicates.cs`, `DiGi.GIS.Analytical.xUnit/Facts/BuildingModel_Enclosed.cs`.

### 8. Branch Synchronization & Versioning Protocol
1. **Version branch only:** run only when the active branch is a bare SemVer `*.*.*` (e.g. `0.8.2`, `1.12.0`). Skip anything with text, prefix, or suffix (`feature/login`, `v0.8.2`, `0.8.2-beta`, `main`).
2. **Differs from main:** run only for repos where the active branch differs from `main`; skip repos where they are identical.

#### 🔄 Synchronization Workflow (Execution Steps)
1. **Sync with main:** merge the version branch into `main` so both hold the exact same codebase, with no pending diffs.
2. **Bump patch:** increment the third version digit by 1 (`0.8.2` → `0.8.3`).
3. **Branch off main** using that new version name.
4. **Update `Directory.Build.props`** (if present): set `<Major>`/`<Minor>`/`<Build>` to the new version's components and commit on the new branch before pushing.
5. **Push & track:** push both `main` and the new version branch to `origin`, using `-u` on the new branch so it tracks properly (`git push -u origin <version_branch>`).

### 9. Full Guideline Set

`DiGi.Maintenance/documentation/AI Guidelines/` (path relative to the workspace root, since they sit in

> **One data rule worth knowing before it bites you:** a GIS county `code` does **not** identify one row.
> BDOT10k stores one `administrative_areal_2d` feature per polygon part, so 406 county rows cover 380
> codes, and 18 counties have several. Key every write and lookup by county **`id`**, give every
> `LIMIT`/`FirstOrDefault` over that table an explicit `ORDER BY`, and never "deduplicate" those rows —
> for `2412 rybnicki` the largest polygon is only 52 % of the county. Two corollaries that have each
